# Climate NLP Community

We're a collective of practitioners and researchers working on natural language processing applied to various climate change applications. 

As a community, we aim to:

- Collaborate and provide feedback on concrete, impactful climate NLP projects
- Share resources, e.g. data, code, learning, infrastructure and project outcomes
- Share learning, informing each other of current developments and interesting resources
- Proactively mentor female+ and underrepresented groups to be involved in the work of this community
